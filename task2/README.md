# Task 2

## DEscription 
This folder contains my proposal solution for Task 2, which is part of the recruitment process for the Junior Data Engineer position at Tidio. Task 2 mainly involves creating a view that might be used for some sort of marketing purposes, as well as an additional query that allows us to check when users withdraw their marketing consent. The main answers for both are inside the `./queries` folder. Additionally, I've started to create a dbt project, but since I don't have much time left, I won't develop it any further. So, I'll keep `tidio_dbt` in this repo just as a fun fact :)
